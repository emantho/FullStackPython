            <h2>Ribs in the oven</h2>
            Oven, slow cooker or on the barbecue; pork ribs are so versatile they can be cooked either way.
            If you love soft, fall-off-the-bone ribs, then go for our <ins>slow cooker method</ins>.
            But, if you love juicy, tender and crispy ribs with caramelised edges, then this oven ribs method is for
            you!
            </p>

                    <h3>How to remove the membrane/skin off baby back ribs</h3>
                </b>
                This is a controversial and personal step when cooking ribs. I grew up eating ribs with the skin left on
                and
                only started removing them about 10 years ago â€” advice from a chef. Personally, I love the chewiness of
                the
                membrane when left on, BUT, I also love the ease of eating ribs with it removed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Go with what YOU love!
            <ul>
                <li>Turn ribs over with bone/rack-side facing up.</li>
                <li>Carefully slide a blunt knife under the membrane at one end of the rack.</li>
                <li>Lift to loosen the membrane off of the bone.</li>
                <li>Using a sheet of paper towel to hold onto the membrane, peel it off the back of the ribs.</li>
                <li>It should come off in one piece.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to cook ribs in the oven</h2>
            The easiest barbecue ribs besides slow cooking!
            <ul>
                <li>Prepare ribs as above, then pat them dry with a sheet of paper towel.</li>
                <li>Rub with our dry rub mixture (recipe below). I like to drizzle some olive oil over them for the best
                    juicy,
                    tender and crispy results.</li>
                <li>Arrange them on a lined baking tray. You can use foil or parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Bake for a couple of hours, then slather with our BBQ sauce mixture. Use a brush or spoon to spread
                    it evenly
                    over the tops.</li>
                <li>Broil (or grill) for an additional 2-5 minutes to get crispy, charred edges.</li>
            </ul>
